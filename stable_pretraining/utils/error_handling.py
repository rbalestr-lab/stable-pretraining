def with_hf_retry_ratelimit(func, *args, delay=10, max_attempts=100, **kwargs):
    """Calls the given function with retry logic for HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors.

    This function attempts to call `func(*args, **kwargs)`. If a rate-limiting error (HTTP 429)
    is encountered—detected via exception type, status code, or error message—it will wait
    for the duration specified by the HTTP `Retry-After` header (if present), or fall back to
    the `delay` parameter, and then retry. Retries continue up to `max_attempts` times.
    Non-429 errors are immediately re-raised. If all attempts fail due to 429, the last
    exception is raised.
    Exceptions handled:
        - huggingface_hub.utils.HfHubHTTPError
        - requests.exceptions.HTTPError
        - OSError
    429 detection is performed by checking the exception's `response.status_code` (if available)
    or by searching for '429' or 'Too Many Requests' in the exception message.
    Parameters:
        func (callable): The function to call.
        *args: Positional arguments to pass to `func`.
        delay (int, optional): Default wait time (in seconds) between retries if `Retry-After`
            is not provided. Defaults to 10.
        max_attempts (int, optional): Maximum number of attempts before giving up. Defaults to 5.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to `func`.

    Returns:
        The return value of `func(*args, **kwargs)` if successful.

    Raises:
        Exception: The original exception if a non-429 error occurs, or if all attempts fail.

    Example:

        >>> model = with_retry(
        ...     AutoModel.from_pretrained,
        ...     "facebook/ijepa_vith14_1k",
        ...     delay=10,
