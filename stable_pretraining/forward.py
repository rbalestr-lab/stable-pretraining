"""Forward functions for self-supervised learning methods.

This module provides pre-defined forward functions for various SSL methods
that can be used with the Module class. These functions define the training
logic for each method and can be specified in YAML configs or Python code.

Example:
    Using in a YAML config::

        module:
          _target_: stable_pretraining.Module
          forward: stable_pretraining.forward.simclr_forward
          backbone: ...
          projector: ...

    Using in Python code::

        from stable_pretraining import Module
        from stable_pretraining.forward import simclr_forward

        module = Module(forward=simclr_forward, backbone=backbone, projector=projector)
